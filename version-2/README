1. To compile the program, use the following shell command:

	make


2. To execute the program, use the following shell command:

	./alarm_app


3. At the prompt "Alarm> ", type one of the following commands:

	Type A: Time Message(Type, Number) AlarmMessage
	Type B: Create_Thread: MessageType(Type)
	Type C: Cancel: Message(Number)

	Where Message, Create_Thread, MessageType, and Cancel are
	all reserved keywords by the program.

	Time is an unsigned number denoting the amount of time
	to wait between two consecutive prints of the alarm.

	Type is an unsigned number used to categorize different alarms.

	Number is an unsigned number used to uniquely identify different
	alarms. Note that a new alarm with a given Number will replace an
	existing alarm with that Number since Number is the primary key.

	And finally AlarmMessage is a non-empty string of maximum length
	50. Note that longer strings will be truncated to 50 characters.
	This restriction on 50 characters can easily be modified by
	changing #define MAX_MSG_LEN 50 in alarm_def.h


	Examples of parse-valid commands:
		20 Message(2, 3) Hello World !
		Create_Thread: MessageType(5)
		Cancel: Message(7)


4. To exit the program, enter Ctrl+D which signals End Of File(EOF).
