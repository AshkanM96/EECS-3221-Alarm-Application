When running the application, you will see the following prompt
"Alarm> ", at which point you should enter one of the following
command types: Type A, Type B, or Type C specified below
Type A: Time MessageType(Type) AlarmMessage
Type B: Create_Thread: MessageType(Type)
Type C: Terminate: MessageType(Type)

Where MessageType, Create_Thread, and Terminate are all reserved
keywords by the program. Time is an unsigned number denoting the
amount of time to wait between two consecutive prints of the alarm.
Type is an unsigned number used to categorize different alarms.
And finally, AlarmMessage is a non-empty string of maximum length 50.
Note that longer strings will be truncated to 50 characters. This
restriction on 50 characters can easily be modified by changing
#define MAX_MSG_LEN 50 in alarm_def.h

Examples of valid commands:
    20 MessageType(2) Hello World !
    Create_Thread: MessageType(3)
    Terminate: MessageType(5)



What does each command do?

Type A commands create a new alarm with the given time, type, and
message to be handled by an alarm thread of the same type.

Type B commands create a new alarm thread with the given type, which
handles any alarms that are of the same type and have not been assigned
to any other alarm threads.

Type C commands terminate all alarm threads of the given type and also
delete all messages of that type from the alarms list.
